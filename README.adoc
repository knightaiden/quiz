URL: http://localhost:8080/user

Body: {"name": "Tom"}

  Tom is example, you could use the name like John, emily and so on.

Method: POST

Return: {name": "Tom", "TotalNumbers": ??}
  
  name should be what you got by Body
  
  ?? should be the actual numbers of users whose name is what you are searching

It should be finished based on the current framework.

You should think it's a real requirement so you could consider all the cases that would happen.

You need to finish it using the current framework
Controller -> UserService -> dao (having been finished)

You need to login with your own github account(if you don't have please create one) and then fork a branch from the master branch of mine. After you finish you could commit a pull request to master branch of mine.
